This is our final project in school.

We will implement a carbon footprint calculator website when the individuals can measure their direct and/or indirect carbon emissions.
The calculation is intended to involve food, travel, electricity, waste reuse... etc. parameters.

The functionality will cover advice to improve a better lifestyle and provide more efficient sustainability.
The final product will be awesome.
