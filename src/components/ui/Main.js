                        The carbon footprint is an important component of the Ecological Footprint, since it is one competing demand for biologically productive space. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The carbon Footprint is currently 60 percent of humanity’s overall Ecological Footprint and its most rapidly growing component. Humanity’s carbon Footprint has 
                        increased 11-fold since 1961. Reducing humanity’s carbon Footprint is the most essential step we can take to end overshoot and live within the means of our planet.

                                When calculating a carbon footprint, a lot of factors are taken into consideration. For example, driving to the grocery store burns a certain amount of fuel, 
                                and fossil fuels are the primary sources of greenhouses gases. But that grocery store is powered by electricity, and its employees probably drove to work, 
                                so the store has its own carbon footprint.In addition, the products that the store sells were all shipped there, so that must also be factored into the total 
                                carbon footprint.
                            </p>
                            <p>Beyond that, the fruits, vegetables, and meats that the store sells were all grown or raised on farms, a process that produces methane,
                                which has a greenhouse effect 25 times greater than CO2.
                            </p>
                            <p>All of those elements must be combined to understand the full carbon footprint of a given activity.</p>
                            <p> Although adding up one’s individual carbon footprint can be difficult, online calculators can do some of the work for you, giving a rough estimate of your carbon 
                                footprint based on the size of your household, the efficiency of your appliances, how much you drive or fly, what you eat, and how much you recycle.
